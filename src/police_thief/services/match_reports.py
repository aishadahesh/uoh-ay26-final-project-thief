"""The four mandatory match-lifecycle JSON reports (Chapter 9, Sec. 9.3.16-9.3.22).

docs/tasks.md Sec. 9.3.19-9.3.20: a match's full lifecycle is covered by four
separate, namespaced JSON files -- never one blob, so files never mix across
different matches or sub-games:

    declaration_<game_id>.json        -- pre-game fixed match data
    config_<game_id>_g<NN>.json       -- the agreed, cryptographically-locked config snapshot
    log_<game_id>_g<NN>.json          -- the full commit/reveal move log (Chapter 5/7's format, reused as-is)
    result_<game_id>.json             -- final score, sign-off, and all four repo cross-links

Each builder is a thin dataclass + canonical-JSON writer; no bespoke crypto
is invented here -- SHA-256 hashing reuses Chapter 5's canonical_json, and
the log file itself reuses Chapter 7's save_log/load_log exactly (Sec. 9.3.19
explicitly calls the log file "for cryptographic audit in a replay
simulator" -- the same file Chapter 7's Replay Viewer already consumes).
