"""Commit-Reveal cryptographic protocol over SHA-256 (Chapter 5).

docs/tasks.md Sec. 5.1-5.4: in a referee-less P2P match, "hindsight
rewriting" (changing a move after the fact) is the central cheating risk.
The fix is mathematical, not contractual: a commitment cryptographically
binds a side to State+Move+Intent before either side reveals anything,
using a fresh Nonce to defeat both hash reuse and dictionary attacks
(Blum 1983's "coin-flipping over the telephone"; the Zero-Knowledge framing
is Goldwasser-Micali-Rackoff 1989 -- Sec. 5.3).

This module implements only the crypto primitives (commit/verify) and the
end-of-match mutual audit over a whole log. The actual 4-step network
protocol sequencing (Commit -> Acknowledge -> Reveal -> Audit, enforced so
steps cannot be skipped or reordered) is Chapter 8's Orchestrator/state-
machine responsibility -- not built here.
